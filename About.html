<p>
I was born in raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Like many New Mexicans, I enjoy desert landscapes, eating chile, and bragging about <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Flag_of_New_Mexico.svg">my state's flag</a>.

In my free time, I enjoy playing jazz piano (there was a time when I wanted to become a professional musician, like the rest of my family). I've actually played in a handful of community theater musicals, but COVID has sadly put a stop to that sort of thing for the foreseeable future. My other hobbies include studying Chinese, playing strategy games, teaching myself cool math and cooking (mostly Sichuanese food).
