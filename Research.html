My primary research interests lie in <span id="Research-cryptography"></span><strong id="cryptography">cryptography</strong>, <span id="Research-computer security"></span><strong id="computer security">computer security</strong>, and <span id="Research-digital privacy"></span><strong id="digital privacy">digital privacy</strong>. I'm always happy to explore new areas, however, and there are many topics in computer science, mathematics and philosophy that fascinate me. Broadly speaking, I enjoy intuitively simple ideas which give rise to surprising complexity and depth. I am also deeply interested in the ethical dimension of scientific research and increasing the accessibility of STEM.

At the University of Arizona, I have had the great fortune to work under the guidance of both <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kobourov/">Dr. Kobourov</a> and <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~debray/">Dr. Debray</a>. My projects with them are described below:

MetroSets is an online platform for set visualization which I helped to create as part of my research with Dr. Kobourov. The basic idea is to borrow the visual language of metro maps and apply it to abstract data, with sets drawn as metro lines and elements drawn as stations. Here's an example:

</p>

<p>
In recent months, our focus has been on empirically evaluating our system through a controlled user study. A paper describing our results and situating MetroSets in the broader ecosystem of set visualization tools is currently under review.

In recognition of my work on MetroSets, I was selected for honorable mention for the Computing Research Association's Outstanding Undergraduate Researcher Award for 2021.

<p>
My work with Dr. Debray has focused on understanding the problem of authorship attribution for programs, and reckoning with the surprising fact that it seems to be possible to figure out who wrote a program solely using stylistic features from the compiled binary. Currently, we are working to reproduce the results of a state of the art system for binary authorship attribution. Simultaneously, we are designing a tool for efficient black-box adversarial ML using non-standard compiler optimizations. Our ultimate goal is to A) develop a better understanding of the robustness of binary attribution techniques, and B) to determine if there are steps that ethical programmers can take to avoid being deanonymized by these tools while still sharing their programs.
